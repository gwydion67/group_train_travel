## Overview
### I along with multiple of my fellow KGPians have quite a few time had faced boring rides, staring out the window alone in the train. Wishing that "kash koi aur hota saath me" only to know that someone i know was sharing the same train. Ah!.
Our idea is to fix this. This app aims to help the KGPians sharing routes and destinations to share the journey while strengthening the bonds all while having a fun trip
## Building
#### The framework/stack that we have chosen to go forward with is:
 - React native (frontend)
 - Django (backend)
 - PSQL (database)
 - JWT (Auth)
 - IRCTC API and Train Running Status (by Rapid Api)

## Troubleshooting
### Will be planned after a successful release 

## Concerns 
- Maintaining the privacy and security of the data of students
- Assuring the data is not accessible to unauthorized personnel and only to students
- ..etc

## Release Notes
Can be found in [RELEASE_NOTES](RELEASE_NOTES.md).
